What I learned from this Project :
- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental #CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices.
These are the outcomes of this project

This project is the result of imitating the YouTube video Tutorial by JavaScript Mastery YouTube channel
